        <h2>SDRKit</h2>
        <h4>Abstraction</h4>

        <script nb>
            var SDR = SDRKit.SDR
            var map = new SDRKit.SDRMap()
            var range = 1024
            var population = 8
        </script>

        <p>
            SDRs can be intercompared to yield abstractions that represent similarities and differences. There is a clear similarity between a and b (below). The similarity can be abstracted simply by using the AND operator. The difference can be abstracted using the XOR operator.
        </p>
        <script nb="1">
            var a = [0,1,2,3, 10,11,12,13]
            var b = [0,1,2,3, 20,21,22,23]
            var c = SDR.AND([a,b])
            var d = SDR.XOR([a,b])
            print(1,'similarities: ',c)
            print(1,'differences: ',d)
        </script>

        <p>
            The a and b representations are associated directly by their overlap. But representations can be associated in more ways than just local overlap. Representations can be associated by similar differences. An analogy will be used here.
        </p>
        <script nb>
            dict = new SDRKit.SDRDictionary(4)
            dict.set([0,1,2,3],'bottle')
            dict.set([5,6,7,8],'ball')
            dict.set([10,11,12,13],'red')
            dict.set([20,21,22,23],'blue')
        </script>

        <p>
            Above, there are two abstract objects: bottle &amp; ball, and two abstract colours: red &amp; blue.
        </p>
        <script nb>
            dict.set([10,11,12,13,0,1,2,3],'red bottle')
            dict.set([20,21,22,23,0,1,2,3],'blue bottle')
            dict.set([10,11,12,13,5,6,7,8],'red ball')
            dict.set([20,21,22,23,5,6,7,8],'blue ball')
        </script>

        <p>
            There is now also 'concrete' objects: red bottle, blue bottle, red ball and blue ball. As an SDRDictionary is just an SDRMap with strings as the values, the abstract bottle key can be used to retrieve all things related to bottle. The same is true for other abstract SDRs.
        </p>
        <script nb="2">
            print(2,'bottle: ',dict.get([0,1,2,3]))
            print(2,'ball: ',dict.get([5,6,7,8]))
            print(2,'red: ',dict.get([10,11,12,13]))
            print(2,'blue: ',dict.get([20,21,22,23]))
        </script>

        <p>
            It is clear here how things are related with direct similarity. However, there is another abstraction that can be made to relate the objects. There is an indirect similarity between the pair of bottles and the pair of balls. The similarity is the difference in colour between the pair of objects.
        </p>
        <script nb="3">
            bottleDiff = SDR.XOR([[10,11,12,13,0,1,2,3],[20,21,22,23,0,1,2,3]])
            print(3,'difference between bottles: ',bottleDiff)
            ballDiff = SDR.XOR([[10,11,12,13,5,6,7,8],[20,21,22,23,5,6,7,8]])
            print(3,'difference between balls: ',ballDiff)
        </script>

        <p>
            The difference between the pair of bottles and the pair of balls are the same/similar. The difference SDR is actually just a union of red and blue.
        </p>
